Loan Data Analysis

Introduction:
This repository contains the code and data files for performing loan data analysis. 
The purpose of this project is to explore and analyze a dataset related to loans to gain insights, patterns, and trends that can be useful for decision-making in the lending domain.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this analysis is stored in the "loan_data.csv" file. It includes various features related to loan applications, 
such as loan amount, interest rate, borrower's credit score, employment status, loan status, etc.
Before running the analysis, ensure that the dataset file is present in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.

Code:
The analysis code is provided in the "Loan_Data_Analysis.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook file. 
The notebook is structured into sections, each covering specific aspects of data analysis, such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and visualization. 
The code is written in Python using popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
